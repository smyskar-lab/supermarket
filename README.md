This project analyzes sales data from the supermarket for the Q1-2019 and provides some insights on improvements for increasing revenues (and eventually gross margins) and discusses various ways to improve customer ratings for their stores.

This project has data file avaialble in the repository (supermarket_sales.csv) and jupyter notebook (supermarket_data blog,ipynb) which explains the process used to analyze the data and provide some recommendation on improving revenues of the supermarket. 

I have used pandas, numpy and matplotlib python packages for all the analysis in the jupyter notebook.
